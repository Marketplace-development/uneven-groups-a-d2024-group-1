## How Our Code Works
In our demo video, we explain the basic functionalities of our site.

### Layout  
We began by designing a template in Figma, which served as a working document throughout development. As our website evolved, we continuously updated the Figma file to reflect the changes. The final Figma version includes the structure for most of our website's pages.  

For the homepage, main page, login, and signup pages, we drew inspiration from an online template. This approach gave our website a more polished and professional appearance.  

- **Demo Video**: [Basic Functionalities Chairing](https://vicvereecke2.wistia.com/medias/omxv00fxo0)  
- **Figma File**: [Chairing Design](https://www.figma.com/design/lpcroGTkpFvW8u9mU9Tbih/Chairing?node-id=0-1&t=jZgN5xBRTQklAzLF-1)  
- **Template Reference**: [React Markit Template](https://react-markit.vercel.app/home)  

### File-Specific Details  
Below, you can find explanations about various parts of our code, along with the functions we used. These functions are located in the `routes.py` file.  

---

#### `home.html`  
The reviews displayed on this page are for layout purposes only and are not part of the actual review system.  

**Function used**: `home()`  

---

#### `login.html` & `signup.html`  
- **Signup Process**:  
  - Users must provide a username and phone number (both mandatory).  
  - If required fields are left blank, an error message is displayed.  
  - Passwords are required alongside a confirmation password to ensure accuracy. If the two passwords do not match, an error message is shown.  

- **Login Process**:  
  - The username and password must match an existing record in our database. If either is incorrect, an error is displayed.  

- **Password Security**:  
  For privacy, we store only hashed versions of passwords in our database. This ensures that no one can view or retrieve the original passwords.  

- **Logout Option**:  
  After logging in, you can log out from any page by clicking the **Logout** button in the upper right corner.

**Functions used**: `login()`, `signup()` & `logout()`

---

### `main-page.html`  
**This Week's Highlighted Locations**:  
The highlighted locations are selected based on the highest ratings received during the previous week. This list updates every Monday at 00:00. The stars displayed in the containers represent the all-time average rating of each location (not just for the previous week).  

**Functions used**: `main_page()` & `get_highlighted_locations()`

---

### `account.html`  
#### **Personal Information**  
Here, you can update your username or phone number. When you make changes, the previous values are deleted from our database and replaced with the new ones.  

#### **Your Study Targets**  
- You can set two types of weekly targets:  
  1. **Study Time Target**: Tracks the total study time for this week.  
  2. **Study Sessions Target**: Counts the number of study sessions completed this week.  

- Targets are stored in the user table of the database and can be updated anytime.  

- Example:  
  - Today is Wednesday. On Monday, you had a reservation for 120 minutes, and on Thursday, you have a reservation planned for 90 minutes.  
  - You set your weekly targets to **3 hours of study time** and **2 sessions**.  
  - Before Thursday's reservation:  
    - Study progress: **2h00 of 3h00 done**  
    - Session progress: **1 of 2 sessions done**  
  - After Thursday's reservation:  
    - Study progress: **3h30 of 3h00 done** (goal achieved)  
    - Session progress: **2 of 2 sessions done** (goal achieved)  

- A congratulatory message will display when you achieve your weekly goals.  

#### **Student**  
- Displays your **average rating as a student**, rounded to the nearest integer. This rating is calculated from feedback received from the hosts of locations where you made reservations.  
- Below the rating, you can view your previous reservations, including any messages from the host.  
- If you havenâ€™t made any reservations yet, this section will remain empty.  

#### **Location Owner**

  - Notifies students of the cancellation.
